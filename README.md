# Healthcare Waitlist Analysis Dashboard in Power BI

## Introduction
This Power BI dashboard provides an in-depth visualization of patient waitlists across various case types and specialties from January 2018 to March 2021. The analysis segments data by case type (Outpatient, Day Case, Inpatient), specialty, age profile, and time bands to offer insights into patient wait times and their distribution, aiming to enhance healthcare service delivery efficiency.

## Key Findings

- **Total Wait List Comparison**: Observed a decrease in the overall waitlist from 709,000 to 640,000 from the preceding year to the most recent year analyzed.
- **Case Type Split**: Outpatients form the bulk of the cases, making up 72.49% of the total, with Inpatients and Day Cases following.
- **Time Band vs. Age Profile**: Significant wait times were noted for the 0-15 and 65+ age groups, especially for those waiting over 18 months.
- **Monthly Trend Analysis**: Fluctuations are evident in both Day Case/Inpatient and Outpatient waitlists, with a marked increase in Outpatient waitlists over time.

## Context and Interpretation

- The reduction in the total waitlist could indicate either an enhanced patient processing efficiency or a decrease in new cases.
- The predominance of Outpatients in the waitlist may signal a bottleneck in outpatient services or a surge in demand for these services.
- Longer wait times for the youngest and oldest patients might reflect the complexity of their cases or existing prioritization policies.
- The observed seasonal variability suggests potential stress periods on the system or a rising demand for services.

## Recommendations

- **Service Optimization**: Address the bottleneck in outpatient services to lower the high percentage of Outpatients on the waitlist.
- **Prioritization Policy Review**: Re-evaluate age-based prioritization policies to ensure fair wait times across all age brackets.
- **Capacity Management**: Boost capacity during peak months to handle increased volumes and prevent backlog accumulation.
- **Process Improvement**: Enhance the management of Day Cases and Inpatients by possibly incorporating lean management principles.

## Conclusion

The analysis of the Power BI dashboard highlights a multifaceted situation regarding healthcare waitlists, showing signs of progress and areas needing focus. Targeted actions derived from data insights could help healthcare providers reduce wait times and enhance the patient experience.

## Power BI Techniques Used

- **Data Modeling**: Integration of data from various years and sources into a unified model.
- **Visualizations**: Employment of bar charts, pie charts, and line graphs for clear data representation.
- **Filters/Slicers**: Facilitation of data segmentation by date, case type, specialty, age profile, and time bands.
- **DAX Formulas**: Calculation of critical indicators like average/median wait times.
- **Conditional Formatting**: Emphasis on essential metrics and trends, such as growing waitlist sizes.
- **Dashboard Design**: Aesthetic and functional design considerations to make the dashboard both informative and user-friendly.
